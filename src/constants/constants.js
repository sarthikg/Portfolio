	`My journey to this portfolio began in May of 2019 when I first
	started programming in Flutter. Thanks to Android Studio, I could
	finally experience the peak temperatures of my laptop. Anyways, back
	to the story, by the next month, I had started Python, going through
	an online bootcamp, and boy it was easy and fun. It took me about a
	month to complete the Bootcamp after which I began SQL because after
	all, everything cannot be like Snapchat.`,
	`Fast-forward to January of 2020, I began my first internship at a
	startup where I first got exposed to Web-Scraping (ahem!)
	Web-Automation using Selenium. Within a couple of months, I pivoted
	to Web-Development and got my feet wet in this never-ending field.`,
	`Halfway down the Internship, Covid happened. Most of the time post
	then was invested in learning React & Trading. Well, losses were
	made, but at least there's this website :)`,
