### Introduction

As the calendar turned the page into the new year of 2022, the doors of opportunity swung open for the annual coding escapade - GSoC (Google Summer of Code). Little did I know that this would mark a pivotal chapter in my open-source journey.

Back then, having recently started my first job after graduating in May 2021, a college friend asked about my intent to participate in GSoC. I casually dismissed the idea, assuming GSoC was exclusively for college students, as it had been in the past.

Upon further discussion, he updated me that Google had revamped the program, and now, GSoC welcomed graduates as well.

Given the competitive nature of the program and the time-management that will be required alongside a full-time job, I remained skeptical about my participation.

But, I was still leaning towards giving it a shot!

### Project Selection

Initially, GSoC releases a list of participating organizations along with the projects they offer. There are approximately 200 organizations, and each of them presents ten to a hundred projects for consideration.

The challenge was to pinpoint the specific project for which I would be crafting a proposal, and let me tell you, it wasn't a walk in the park. Navigating through the thousands of projects was a bit of a maze, and shortlisting the ones that caught my interest added another layer of complexity.

#### First Round of Shortlisting

My initial attempt at casually navigating across organization pages and jotting down projects of interest ended in a bit of a fiasco. After navigating only around 40 organization pages, I already had a list of 30 or so projects.

During that time, my only criterion for shortlisting projects relied on my preferred tech-stack and the technologies I was eager to learn. However, considering the scalability of my current method of shortlisting, I had to think of a more efficient approach.

It was time to leverage Notion. I created a table and began adding projects while assigning a score to each project based on a few parameters:

1. Impact of the project.
2. Impact of the organization.
3. Familiarity with tech-stack.
4. Interest in the tech-stack.

After navigating through all the organization pages, I had compiled a table with approximately 100-120 projects that piqued even my mild interest.

#### Second Round of Shortlisting

The next step was to trim down the list to around 20-25 projects. To achieve this, I joined the communication channels for all the shortlisted projects. These channels spanned diverse platforms such as Discord, Slack, RocketChat, IRC, and more.

My primary goal in joining these communication channels was to gauge the level of competition associated with each of these projects. Some organizations, such as RocketChat, had even gamified the selection process, featuring a leaderboard of pull requests.

Given a busy routine with a day job, I didn't have the time or energy to engage in gamified selection processes or involve myself with exceptionally competitive organizations. This pragmatic approach helped me narrow down to about 60 projects.

From this pool of around 60 projects, I incorporated the previously assigned scores based on the discussed parameters. By doing so, I effortlessly shortlisted the top 25 projects.

#### Final Round of Shortlisting

With a narrowed-down list of 25 projects, it finally became feasible to delve into detailed research about each one. And that's precisely what I did.
