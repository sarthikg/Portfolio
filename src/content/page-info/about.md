My software engineering journey began **2.5 years** ago, focusing on **web frontend development** in Angular. In this role, I achieved milestones such as creating a **design system**, implementing **micro-frontends**, and optimizing build pipelines. My experience includes working with GraphQL.

In 2022, I participated in **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** with **The Tor Project**, leading the development of **Tor-Weather**. Post-GSoC, I maintained and enhanced the project, culminating in a complete rewrite in July-December 2023. This effort earned me a role as a **Core Contributor** within The Tor Project.

In July 2022, I discovered and reported a bug in Microsoft Azure, qualifying for a **$5000 bug bounty** and earning a spot on the **quarterly and yearly leaderboards**. These experiences define my commitment to innovation and growth in the ever-evolving field of software engineering.
