My journey in the realm of software engineering has been nothing short of a dynamic and transformative adventure over the past three years. Transitioning from my initial foray into programming, I have spent the last 2.5 years as a dedicated software engineer, specializing in web frontend development using Angular.

Within this role, I have achieved significant milestones, including the creation of a robust design system in Angular, the sole implementation of micro-frontends, and the optimization of intricate build pipelines. My expertise extends to utilizing GraphQL, showcasing my commitment to staying at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies.

A pivotal chapter in my professional journey unfolded when I participated in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) in 2022, collaborating with The Tor Project. During this immersive experience, I took the initiative to develop Tor-Weather, a project that I continued to maintain and enhance post-GSoC. Notably, in June-July 2023, I spearheaded a comprehensive rewrite of the project, a testament to my dedication and proficiency in software development, ultimately leading to my role as a Core Contributor within The Tor Project.

Adding to the tapestry of my accomplishments, in July 2022, I unearthed and reported a significant bug in Microsoft Azure, exposing an information disclosure vulnerability. This discovery not only earned me a commendable $5000 bug bounty but also secured my place on the quarterly and yearly leaderboards. These experiences have not only shaped my technical prowess but have also fueled my passion for pushing boundaries and contributing meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering. As I continue to embark on this exciting journey, I remain steadfast in my commitment to innovation and continuous growth.
