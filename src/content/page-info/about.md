My journey in software engineering commenced **2.5 years** ago, specializing in **web frontend development** with a focus on **Angular**. During this time, I achieved significant milestones, including the creation of a **design system**, implementation of **micro-frontends**, and successful management of **major-version upgrades**.

In 2022, I had the privilege of being selected for [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) with [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/), where I took the lead in developing [Tor-Weather](https://weather.torproject.org). Following GSoC, my commitment persisted as I continued to maintain and enhance the project, culminating in a complete rewrite from July to December 2023. This dedication led to my appointment as a Core Contributor within The Tor Project, a recognition highlighted on their [Core Contributors page](https://www.torproject.org/about/people/).

In July 2022, I discovered and reported a bug in Microsoft Azure, earning me a **$5000 bug bounty** and securing a position on both the **quarterly and yearly leaderboards**. These experiences underscore my unwavering commitment to innovation and personal growth in the dynamic field of software engineering.
