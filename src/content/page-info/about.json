Thanks to Android Studio, I could finally experience the peak temperatures of my laptop. Anyways, back to the story, by the next month, I had started Python, going through an online bootcamp, and boy it was easy and fun. It took me about a month to complete the Bootcamp after which I began SQL because after all, everything cannot be like Snapchat.`, `Fast-forward to January of 2020, I began my first internship at a startup where I first got exposed to Web-Scraping (ahem!) Web-Automation using Selenium. Within a couple of months, I pivoted to Web-Development and got my feet wet in this never-ending field.`, `Halfway down the Internship, Covid happened. Most of the time post then was invested in learning React & Trading. Well, losses were made, but at least there's this website :)"
